1. According to the linear regression function we performed utilizing R, both the weight of the vehicle and AWD influenced the variance of the mpg values in the dataset.

2. The slope of the linear model cannot be considered as zero due to the fact that this is a multiple linear regression analysis with multiple independent variables affecting the dependent vairable.

3. However, this linear model does not represent an effective represenation. One particular reason is that the input data should be numerical and continuous i.e. following a linear pattern.
